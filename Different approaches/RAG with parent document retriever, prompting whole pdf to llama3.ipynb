      "QUERY: Whats the difference between Grouped and Combined lamps?\n",
      "RESPONSE: Thank you for your question! In the context of vehicle lighting, \"Grouped\" and \"Combined\" lamps refer to different types of lamp configurations. Here's a brief explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Grouped Lights: In this configuration, multiple lamps are mounted on the same axis and are aimed in the same direction. The lamps are typically spaced at regular intervals along the vehicle's length, usually every 30-40 cm. Grouped lights are used to provide a wide beam of light that illuminates the road ahead without creating glare for other drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined Lights: In this configuration, two or more lamps are mounted on different axes and aimed in different directions. The lamps are typically spaced at regular intervals along the vehicle's length, usually every 30-40 cm. Combined lights are used to provide a wider field of vision than grouped lights while minimizing glare for other drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Grouped lights are mounted on the same axis and aimed in the same direction, while Combined lights are mounted on different axes and aimed in different directions. Both configurations have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on the specific use case and requirements of the vehicle or application.\n",

      "QUERY: Can dipped-beam headlamp and main-beam headlamp for front lighting system?\n",
      "RESPONSE: Yes, dipped-beam headlamps and main-beam headlamps can be used together in a front lighting system. The dipped-beam headlamp provides low beam illumination when the vehicle is driving at low speeds or in urban areas, while the main-beam headlamp provides high beam illumination when the vehicle is driving at higher speeds or on rural roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the standard EU legislation (ECE R99 and ECE R128), vehicles must be equipped with dipped-beam headlamps and main-beam headlamps that can be automatically switched between low and high beam based on the vehicle speed and road conditions. The dipped-beam headlamp should be able to run automatically when the vehicle is driving at speeds of 50 km/h or less, while the main-beam headlamp should be able to run automatically when the vehicle is driving at speeds above 50 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, vehicles must also be equipped with a daytime running light (DRL) system that can be activated automatically when the vehicle's engine is running. The DRL system provides illumination of the front of the vehicle during the daytime, improving visibility and safety for other road users.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, dipped-beam headlamps and main-beam headlamps are both essential components of a modern front lighting system in vehicles, providing optimal illumination for different driving conditions and improving safety on the roads.\n",

      "QUERY: Can yellow lamp used as front fog lamp?\n",
      "RESPONSE: The question appears to be related to the compatibility of yellow lamps with the requirements outlined in the standard. According to the standard, front fog lamps are required to have a beam angle of 20-40 degrees and a color temperature of 3500K or less. Yellow lamps typically have a beam angle of around 20-30 degrees and a color temperature of around 1700K-2000K, which is closer to the standard's requirement for front fog lamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the standard does not explicitly prohibit the use of yellow lamps as front fog lamps. In fact, some manufacturers may choose to use yellow lamps for their fog lighting functionality, particularly in situations where a wider beam angle is desirable (e.g., in heavy rain or snow).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while it may not be the most ideal choice for front fog lamps, there is no clear prohibition against using yellow lamps for this purpose in the standard. Ultimately, the decision to use yellow lamps would depend on the specific requirements and preferences of the vehicle manufacturer or owner.\n",

      "If several buttons are used to adjust the beam, the button that gives the greatest downward inclination shall be installed to the left or below the button(s) for other dipped-beam positions. The controls for the headlamp-levelling devices must also meet certain requirements, such as having symbols indicating clearly the movements corresponding to the downward and upward inclination of the beam (Annex H).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question about placing white light at the back of a vehicle, it is possible to use white light in the rear lamp of a vehicle, but there are specific requirements for the placement and intensity of the light. According to EN 13924, the intensity of the light emitted by the rear lamp shall be between 50 and 200 lux at a distance of 20 meters from the vehicle (Annex H1). Additionally, there are requirements for the observation areas of the apparent surface of the manoeuvring lamp, which is located at the back of the vehicle (Figure I.1).\n",

      "QUERY: can dipped beam uses as a main beam?\n",
      "RESPONSE: The European standard EN 13972:2004 outlines the requirements for headlamps on motor vehicles, including dipped beams and main beams. According to the standard, a dipped beam is defined as \"a beam of light with a lower intensity than the main beam, used for driving in conditions of poor visibility.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As for whether a dipped beam can be used as a main beam, the answer is no. The standard specifies that the main beam must have a higher intensity than the dipped beam and be used only when the driver wants to use the maximum light output. The dipped beam is intended for use in conditions of poor visibility, such as during the day or in urban areas, where the light from the main beam would be excessive and cause glare to other road users.\n",

      "QUERY: When collision early warning signal shall be sent?\n",
      "RESPONSE: \n",
      "(1) Answer from Context 1:\n",
      "When the AEBS (Automatic Emergency Braking System) detects the possibility of a collision with a forward vehicle in the same lane, which is traveling at a slower speed, has slowed to a halt or is stationary, it shall send a collision early warning signal. This signal shall be sent when the AEBS has detected the risk of collision and the timing of the warning is important to enable the driver to react timely and avoid nuisance warnings (4.2.2). The warning signal can be acoustic, haptic or optical, and if an optical signal is used, it may also flash to indicate a failure (4.2.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) Answer from Context 2:\n",
      "In Context 2, the question is asked differently, focusing on the timing of the collision early warning signal. The answer is that the signal shall be sent when the AEBS detects the possibility of a collision with a forward vehicle in the same lane, which is traveling at a slower speed, has slowed to a halt or is stationary (4.2.1). The timing of the warning is important to enable the driver to react timely and avoid nuisance warnings (4.2.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) Comparison:\n",
      "Both answers agree that when the AEBS detects the possibility of a collision with a forward vehicle in the same lane, it shall send a collision early warning signal. They also agree on the importance of timing of the warning to enable the driver to react timely and avoid nuisance warnings. However, Context 1 provides more details on the types of signals that can be used for the collision early warning, while Context 2 focuses more on the timing of the warning signal.\n",

      "(2) ANSWER 2 (Context 2): The vehicle manufacturer shall provide a list of positive actions to the technical service at the time of type approval, which includes deactivation of the AEBS function when the ignition switch is turned to the \"off\" position. This is specified in the vehicle manufacturer's guidelines for the AEBS system.\n",
