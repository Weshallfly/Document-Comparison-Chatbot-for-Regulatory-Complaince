It helps to make the vehicle more visible to other road users by highlighting its overall shape and size. There are two types of contour markings: full contour marking and partial contour marking. A full contour marking indicates the outline of the vehicle by a continuous line, while a partial contour marking indicates the horizontal dimension of the vehicle by a continuous line and the vertical dimension by marking the upper corners. In the case of a partial contour marking, each upper corner is described by two lines at 90Â° to each other, each at least 250 mm in length.\"),\n",

Furthermore, section 6.22.7.4 specifies that the passing beam function of the AFS is divided into different classes (C, V, E, and W) and modes, each with its own set of activation conditions and requirements. For instance, the class C mode of the passing beam shall be activated if no mode of another passing-beam class is activated, while the class V mode shall not operate unless certain conditions such as road type and vehicle speed are met.\"),           \n",

According to section 6.22.7.1.1, the lighting units for the main-beam, including AFS, can be activated either simultaneously or in pairs, allowing for the use of AFS as a main beam. Additionally, section 6.22.7.2. specifies that when changing over to the dipped-beam, all main-beam headlamps or AFS lighting units for the main-beam must be switched off or deactivated simultaneously, further supporting the use of AFS as a main beam.\"),  \n",

Additionally, section 6.10.6 specifies that the orientation of the rear position lamp is 'Rearwards', suggesting that the lamp should emit a red light, not white. Furthermore, section 5 states that conspicuity marking should be red or yellow to the rear, and section 6.14 specifies that the rear retro-reflector shall conform to the requirements concerning Class IA or IB retro-reflectors in Regulation No. 3, which likely do not allow white light.

The direction-indicator lamps require a flashing warning light in the Tell-tale to indicate malfunction or failure, as specified in Section 6.5.8.

The provided sections (6.10.4.1 and 6.5.4.3) discuss the distance between the inner edges of the apparent surfaces and the forward boundary of the vehicle's overall length, respectively, but do not mention the minimum distance from the rear part of the vehicle.

According to paragraph 6.11.7.1, the rear fog lamp(s) cannot be switched on unless one of these specific lamps is already lit. This means that switching on other lamps, such as parking lamps or side marker lamps, will not activate the rear fog lamp.
