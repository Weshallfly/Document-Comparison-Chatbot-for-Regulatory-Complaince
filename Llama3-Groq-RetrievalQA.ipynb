So if the context is irravalent , you can't say the pdf doesn't provide infomation about the query. did you understand what I am saying. If I tell you in the prompt that the llm(you) are used in a rag implementation, will you able to act accordingly? Will it improve the responses?. Write a good prompt for the same issue (for the same issue i mentioned before), insuer that prompt is short and understandable by the llm\").content)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(llama3.invoke(\"Telling a llm that he(llm) is being used in a Retrieval augmented generation implementation.
