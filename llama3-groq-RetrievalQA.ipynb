For validation test support, describe how to inspect the work state under normal operation and failure mode of AEBS.\n\nPlease note that these are general steps and the exact procedures may vary depending on the specific requirements and the system being tested.\n\n**ANSWER 2**: I can't find the exact answer in the context, but these may be helpful:\n\nThe test procedures for the system, as outlined in the context, include:\n\n1. Verification of the function of the system: This involves testing the normal operational levels of the system under non-fault conditions. The performance of the system is verified against the manufacturer's basic benchmark specification, unless there is a specified performance test as part of the approval procedure of this or another Regulation.\n\n2. Verification of the safety concept: The reaction of the system is checked under the influence of a failure in any individual unit. Corresponding output signals are applied to electrical units or mechanical elements to simulate the effects of internal faults within the unit. The verification results should correspond with the documented summary of the failure analysis, to a level of overall effect that confirms the adequacy of the safety concept and execution.\n\n3. Verification of the performance of the vehicle system: This is conducted against the manufacturer's basic benchmark specification.\n\n4. Verification of the reaction of the system under the influence of a failure in any individual unit: This is done to check the safety concept of the system.\n\n5. Inspection of the methods and tools used in the design and development process: The manufacturer should be able to show evidence of the means by which they determined the realization of the system logic during the design and development process.\n\n6. Explanation of the design provisions built into the system: The manufacturer should provide an explanation of the design provisions built into the system to generate safe operation under fault conditions. Examples of design provisions for failure in the system include fall-back to operation using a partial system, change-over to a separate backup system, and removal of the high-level function. In case of a failure, the driver should be warned by a warning signal or message display.\n\n**COMPARISION**: The two answers provided discuss the test procedures for a system, specifically the Advanced Emergency Braking System (AEBS), in detail. Both answers highlight the importance of performing function tests under non-fault state of the vehicle system and verifying the function of the system under normal operational levels. They also mention the need to verify the safety concept by simulating the influence of internal faults and inspecting the reaction of the system in case of failure of a single assembly or unit.\n\nHowever, there are some differences between the two answers. Answer 1 provides more specific steps for the test procedures, such as describing the sufficiency of relevant safety concepts and their implementation effects, performing function tests as per special test procedures specified in this standard or other standards, and inspecting the work state under normal operation and failure mode of AEBS. Answer 2, on the other hand, includes additional steps such as verification of the performance of the vehicle system against the manufacturer's basic benchmark specification, verification of the reaction of the system under the influence of a failure in any individual unit, inspection of the methods and tools used in the design and development process, and explanation of the design provisions built into the system.\n\nIn summary, while both answers discuss the test procedures for a system in detail, Answer 1 provides more specific steps for the test procedures, while Answer 2 includes additional steps related to the verification of the performance of the vehicle system, inspection of the methods and tools used in the design and development process, and explanation of the design provisions built into the system."},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stdout","text":"12.587482929229736\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query = \"What are warning indications, in details.\"\ns = time.time()\ndisplay(Markdown(RAG1(query)))\nprint(time.time()-s)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-19T16:38:13.353217Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-06-19T16:38:13.353632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-19T16:38:17.391986Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-19T16:38:13.353602Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-19T16:38:17.390867Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>","text/markdown":"**ANSWER 1**: I can't find the exact answer in the provided context, but these may be helpful:\n\nAccording to the context, there are several warning indications mentioned.

Collision warning: This warning is provided when the AEBS has detected the possibility of a collision with a preceding vehicle in the same lane which is traveling at a slower speed, has slowed to a halt, or is stationary having not been identified as moving. The warning shall be provided by at least two modes selected from acoustic, haptic, or optical, and the timing of the warning signals shall be such that they provide the possibility for the driver to react to the risk of collision.\n2. Failure warning: This warning is provided when there is a failure in the AEBS that prevents the requirements of this Regulation from being met. In case of an electrically detectable failure, there shall not be an appreciable time interval between each AEBS self-check, and subsequently, there shall not be an appreciable delay in illuminating the warning signal.\n3. Yellow optical warning signal: This signal is provided when the AEBS is temporarily not available, for example, due to inclement weather conditions.

The second answer provides three warning indications, including collision warning, failure warning, and yellow optical warning signal.\n\nThe collision warning and failure warning in the second answer are similar to the collision early warning and flashing warning signal for failure in the first answer. However, the first answer provides more details on the types of signals used for collision early warning and the timing of the warning signals. The second answer provides more details on the failure warning, including the requirement for an electrically detectable failure and the absence of an appreciable time interval between each AEBS self-check.\n\nThe yellow optical warning signal in the second answer is similar to the optical warning signal for failure in the first answer.

The timing of the early warning signal shall be in compliance with the stipulations of 4.2.2, which states that the warning signal shall enable the driver to react to the risk of collision and take control of the vehicle timely, while avoiding nuisance for the driver by too early or too frequent early warnings.\n\n**ANSWER 2:**\nAccording to Context 2, a collision warning shall be provided when the AEBS has detected the possibility of a collision with a preceding vehicle of category M, N, or O in the same lane, which is traveling at a slower speed, has slowed to a halt, or is stationary (5.2.1.1). The timing of the warning signals shall be such that they provide the possibility for the driver to react to the risk of collision and take control of the situation, and shall also avoid nuisance for the driver by too early or too frequent warnings (5.5.1).\n\n**COMPARISON:**\nBoth answers are partially same. In both contexts, a collision early warning signal shall be sent when the AEBS detects the possibility of a collision with a forward or preceding vehicle in the same lane, which is traveling at a slower speed, has slowed to a halt, or is stationary. The timing of the warning signals is also similar, aiming to enable the driver to react to the risk of collision and take control of the vehicle timely, while avoiding nuisance for the driver by too early or too frequent early warnings.
